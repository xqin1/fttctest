//for toll calculation
1. we use the existing logic and fusion table to generate the toll for every possible routes
2. to make it work, we'll have to modify the file jsCalculations2014.js
    //comment out all Alert statement, just use find/replace in a text editor
3. create file process_route.js, located in folder 'server/scripts' and include it in TP_Map.html. We also need drop the validEndPoints.json in the root folder:
    	<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript" src="js/process_route.js" ></script>

also copy the file valid_end_points to root directory
    	
//for retrieve sectionIDs, the code are comment out since mobile version does not use the sectionIDs yet
4. we need to modify TP_Map.html, function filterMyRoute() to return the calculated query which is issued to google fusion table to get the sectionsIDs
	a. add a variable 'routeWhere', in line 1530
	var routeWhere = {"firstWhere": 'N/A','secondWhere': 'N/A' };
	b. assign value to 'routeWhere' throughout the code, basically replace:
		showMyRoute1(whereCon); TO showMyRoute1(whereCon); routeWhere.firstWhere = whereCon;
		showMyRoute2(whereCon); TO showMyRoute2(whereCon); routeWhere.secondWhere = whereCon;
	c. return the routeWhere variable, in line 1950
		return routeWhere;


5. load the original toll calculator site
6. open Chome Developer, select gMapFrame(TP_Map.html) so that we can access to the new functions
7. at console command, type getAllRoutes()
8. copy the console output and paste it into file 'routesAndToll_raw.json' located in 'server/data' folder
Warning: the output file is quite large and takes some time to copy/paste.
NOTE: it may worthwhile considering using a web service to assemble the JSON file???

9. there're errors on fusion table, and about 1700 routes with empty sectionIDs. copy the data anyway and on server, run process.route.js
currently we are not dealing with sectionIDs
10. it turns out about over 3000 routes has sp and cash as 0, can not identify why
11. on server, run script validateRoute.js to manually add start, end and tollplaza (both sp and cash) to the route cost
