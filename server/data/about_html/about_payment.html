	<!--SunPass Info:-->
	<h3>SunPass</h3>
	<p>
		SunPass is an innovative prepaid toll program.  The most convenient of all payment methods, using SunPass allows 
		drivers to travel through toll plazas without stopping.  This is accomplished by the use of a SunPass transponder, 
		available at many retail establishments, such as Publix, CVS, AAA, and all service plazas along the Turnpike.
	</p>
	<p>
		The transponder, once attached to the inside of the windshield, transmits a radio signal to sensors mounted in the 
		SunPass toll lanes. As one drives through the SunPass lanes, the proper toll amount is deducted from a prepaid account.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lastly, SunPass users pay the lowest possible toll rates, lower than the Cash and Toll-By-Plate payment methods.  Also, 
		toll lanes that accept SunPass will display the SunPass logo.
	</p>

	<!--Toll-By-Plate Info:-->
	<h3>Toll-By-Plate</h3>
	<p>
		The toll-by-plate method is a toll collection system that takes a photo of a vehicle's license plate as it travels under 
		tolling equipment and mails a bill for the tolls incurred over a 30-day period, plus a $2.50 administrative charge, to the 
		registered owner of the vehicle.  The benefit of toll-by-plate is that vehicles do not have to stop while travelling through toll plazas.
	</p>
	<p>
		Turnpike systems without a Cash option will either accept toll-by-plate or SunPass payment options.  The toll rates associated with toll-by-plate 
		are always consistent with the cash toll rates.

	<!--Cash Info:-->
	<h3>Cash</h3>
	<p>
		Motorists paying by cash have two options:  pay the exact toll amount in the <b>'Exact Coins Cars Only'</b> lane or if the motorist does 
		not have the exact toll amount or would like to obtain a receipt, the <b>'Change Provided'</b> lane.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not all <b>'Change Provided'</b> lanes are staffed 24 hours a day, so motorists should be prepared to have exact change at these 
		interchanges, especially after 7 p.m. or on weekends. Toll collection baskets in the <b>'Exact Coins Cars Only'</b> lanes do not make 
		change and drivers should not attempt to insert paper currency in the machinery. Quarters are preferred, but coin baskets accept any 
		combination of nickels, dimes and quarters.
	</p>

	<!--Ticket System Info:-->
	<h3>Ticket System</h3>
	<p>
		In one unique location, toll rates are based on a Ticket System.  The rural area of the Florida's Turnpike, between the Three Lakes Toll 
		Plaza in south Osceola County and the Lantana Toll Plaza in Palm Beach County, utilizes an electronically-created toll card or ticket.  
		The ticket displays the entrance location onto the Turnpike, and the toll is calculated based on the exit location.  Generally, the longer 
		the travel, the higher the toll.
	</p>
	<p>
		Motorists with a SunPass account are not required to obtain a ticket, and can drive through the toll booths, but must stop and wait for 
		the gate to raise if necessary.  Non-SunPass owners who use a ticket may not travel through SunPass only lanes.  Motorists using the ticket 
		payment method who travel through a SunPass only lane will receive a violation notice.
