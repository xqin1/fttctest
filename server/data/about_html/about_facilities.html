<!--

This is where Alin and I are implementing a loop to add the facilities dynamically based on what is the web 
service. That way if the web service changes the UI will be reflected automatically

begin loop...

<h3>Facility Name...</h3>
<div>Description for the current facility</div>
<br />

end loop...

</div>
